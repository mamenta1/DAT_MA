    "### Phase 2: Solve for Large vs. Small Company Bias & Improving Matching Model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Improve Matching Model\n",
    "1. Add 'Basic Information' page (79894dbc337a40828d895f9402aa63de) to webscrape to capture AUM and Assets in USD fields\n",
    "2. Add AUM data to the Preqin download\n",
    "3. Include these two columns as additional factors in a classification model using both name distance and AUM (rather than just name distance)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solve for Large v Small Company Bias\n",
    "1. Keep AUM information as a feature and do ESA to find correlations/visualizations on relationship between AUM and Y\n",
    "2. Split universe into n groups and make n different models for each size group. Or add some size neutralizer factor as part of feature engineering process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Miscellaneous Fixes\n",
    "1. Frequency of setting RI goals and objectives: d0cc681dfa4d45dca3d70f04bc27d284 and swap it with b874458d0ecd4101869208a1fc7bab12, which has no useful information\n",
    "2. Are features dropped because they have exactly the same column name? It seems that way in b8be094467a0406ead601634b02a60c6, b2a82182cc14473b90b72f6bb504fae0, and 8f2ede8902574ce5afc919af9e05c4e0--no duplicate columns exist in my csv. If not, how do you distinguish column selection of identical column names? If so, need to rescrape with new names and make features for 'no oversight/accountability...' for each of the roles below board level.\n",
    "3. Dropdowns weren't considered on 57749b1a39a14fe6942aabb90698b3c1. Choice of Basic, Moderate, or Advanced all returned '1'.\n"
